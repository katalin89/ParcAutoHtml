        matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect.

        This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you as a user of the Website and Volkswagen of America,
        Inc. with respect to this Website and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals,

        Claims of Copyright Violations and Agent for Notice
        The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe
        that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe that
        your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your intellectual property
        rights have been otherwise violated, please provide our Copyright Agent with the following information:

        An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or
        other intellectual property interest
        A description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed
        A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located (e.g., URL), with enough detail that
        we may find it
        Your address, telephone number, and email address
        A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or
        intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law
        A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and
        that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual
        property owner's behalf

        Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with
        requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon us
        actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident.

        We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice with our copyright agent. You should be
        aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

        Our Agent for notice of claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement can be reached as
        follows:

        By email:
        VW.CopyrightAgent@wundermanthompson.com

        Please note that, due to security concerns, attachments cannot be accepted. Accordingly, any notification of
        infringement submitted electronically with an attachment will not be received or processed.

        We can decide to either suspend or terminate the Service without warning, or issue a warning, at any time for
        any reason in our discretion, including for network or system maintenance, improvement, congestion, or failure
        or if we suspect your Service (in whole or in part) is being used for any unauthorized or inappropriate purpose,
        as a result of your breach of these Terms of Service or for reasons unrelated to you or your account with us. If
        suspension or termination of the Service occurs for any reason, you acknowledge and agree that you may not be
        able to access the Service, including the emergency services. In addition, if we are advised by your financing
        company or any Volkswagen Company that you no longer own or lease your vehicle, we may terminate your Service.
        Availability of the Service is also subject to certain technologies or services (provided outside our control)
        remaining commercially available for the Service period and such availability is not guaranteed.

        Your Right to Cancel the Service

        You may cancel the Service at any time by deleting your myVW account. Note that deleting your myVW account will
        deactivate your connected vehicle services from VW Car-Net. Please refer to your myVW account for more
        information.

        Reactivation of Service

        If you voluntarily delete your myVW account, you can create another myVW account at any time. However, if your
        myVW account was terminated or suspended by us you do not have any right to have your Service reactivated, even
        if you cure any of the issues that resulted in the termination or suspension of your Service. It is solely our
        decision as to whether to allow you to have Service again.

        Transfer of Service, Sale of Vehicle, Termination of Lease

        If you sell your Vehicle or terminate your lease, you should delete the vehicle from your myVW account.
        We may communicate with you about the Service by providing you with messages through the Equipment in your
        Vehicle. If you fail to notify us of a sale or transfer of your Vehicle or termination of your lease, we may
        continue to send messages to the Equipment in your Vehicle. We are not responsible for any privacy related
        damages you may suffer as a result of such a failure to notify us of a sale or transfer of your Vehicle.

        7. Authority to Use, Terminate, Change or Transfer Your Service
        We will only accept requests from you (or from someone we believe is you, or someone with your authorization,
        such as your authorized agent) to use, activate, cancel, change, reactivate, or transfer the Service. You agree
        that we can assume that anyone who provides your registration information is authorized to act on your behalf,
        and that we shall have no responsibility or liability for anything that may arise from our providing any
        services to, or acting upon instructions from any such individual, even if such individual is not, in fact,
        authorized by you to use the Service or your account. You should notify us immediately of any breach of security
        or unauthorized use of your Service or account using the contact information in Section 16 of these Terms of
        Service.

        YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE USE OF OR ANY RELIANCE UPON ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT AVAILABLE
        THROUGH THE SERVICE IS SOLELY AND COMPLETELY AT YOUR OWN RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY. IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY
        TO ENSURE THAT YOU (AND/OR ANY OTHER OCCUPANT OF YOUR VEHICLE) FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF THE SERVICE AND

        or damage to your Vehicle or property. You are solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining any and all
        insurance for your Vehicle, your passengers, and your property. No insurance company or insurer will be entitled

        In order for us to provide the Service, the Equipment in your Vehicle must be in good working order and your

        modify the Equipment or add any equipment or software in or to your Vehicle that is not expressly authorized by
        us or is not compatible with the Equipment or Service. You may need to adjust your use of other Vehicle
        features, such as adjusting the volume of your radio to hear the audio portions of the Service. You are solely
        responsible for the proper maintenance of your Vehicle and its systems (including the Equipment) and for keeping
        them in good working order and in compliance with these Terms of Service and all applicable laws.

        No Illegal, Fraudulent or Abusive Use of the Service

        You may not use the Equipment, the Service, the myVW portal on vw.com or the myVW mobile application, in any way
        that is illegal, fraudulent, or abusive, including to harass, threaten, abuse, defame, or slander, any
        individual or entity. You may use our emergency services only for actual emergencies and legitimate vehicle
        assistance needs. You may not use the Service in a manner that interferes with any other customer’s use of our
        Service or our provision of our Service to our other customers. You agree you will not abuse or do anything to
        damage our or any of our Service Partners’ respective business, operations, services, reputatio</p>
